# SAV (Shortest Path Among Cities) - Pascal Implementation

Welcome to the first upload of the "Coding Time Capsule", a nostalgic collection of my own code from the 90s and early 2000s. SAV is a DOS-based Pascal program that calculates the shortest path between cities using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. This program, developed back in 2002, showcases the power of early programming languages like Pascal in solving complex problems. The code is beautifully written and organized, demonstrating the elegance and simplicity of the past while still being fully functional and effective. Please note that the program is written in Spanish.

## Features

- DOS-based user interface
- Floyd-Warshall shortest path algorithm implementation
- Ability to add cities and distances
- Calculates the shortest path between two cities
- Displays all contiguous cities to a given city
- Elegant and well-structured Pascal code

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the SAV program, you will need a Pascal compiler like Free Pascal or Turbo Pascal, and DOSBox for a DOS-like environment.

- [Free Pascal Compiler](https://www.freepascal.org/)
- [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com/)

### Running the Program

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Compile the source code with a Pascal compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable using DOSBox or a similar DOS emulator.

## Usage

The program provides a simple text-based menu with the following options:

1. Carga de ciudades y distancias directas (Load cities and direct distances)
2. Listado de ciudades contiguas (List of contiguous cities)
3. Distancia y camino entre 2 ciudades (Distance and path between 2 cities)
4. Salir (Exit)

Use the menu to navigate through the program and perform the desired actions.

## Acknowledgments

- A special thank you to the creators of Pascal, especially Anders Hejlsberg, the creator of Turbo Borland Pascal, as well as the Free Pascal Compiler and DOSBox for providing the tools to run and experience this nostalgic program.
